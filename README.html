<p>For my google doodle, I decided to do a theme of ghibli&#39;s &quot;My Neighbor Totoro.&quot; The first time I watched this film, it immediately became one of my favorite films. To many, it may be a film about a small family moving to the countryside and learning to cope with their hospitalized with the help of magical creatures in a forest nearby. But to me, it is much more, it isn&#39;t only the plot, characters but their interactions with each other. Each interaction brings me back to when I was younger and gives me comfort to be vunerable. </p>
